## road-semantic-segmentation
Computer vision task that involves using the novel FCN8 architecture to perform semantic segmentation of roads in an image
Pytorch was used to implement the FCN-8 network architecture.

Results:
Validation loss decreased until it plateaued at 0.51.

The average test loss was 0.113. 




To Use:
pip install gradio

python road_segmentation_app.py
